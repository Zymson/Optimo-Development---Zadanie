Renovation plan: 

1) Take out all the furniture 
- all furniture that can be taken out, must be moved to other room. 
- Takie out all the pictures from the wall. 

2) Cover the rest of the items left in the room
- Furniture that couldn't be removed must be covered with foil
- Also it's important to cover the floor. 

3) Painting walls

- After purchasing and choosing a paint I can start a painting.
- I paint the walls in gray and I correct the white color on the ceiling. 

4) We are waiting few hours for paint to dry. 

5) After finish work in the room, we can put back all furniture to the room. 

- We bring in carefully all furniture, because we don't want to damage painted walls. 
- Finally we hang pictures in new frames on the wall
